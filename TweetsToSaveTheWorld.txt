 Please help 🙏 🤲 This does not make any sense.  The fraudulent case has gone too far and the world must be made aware.  I will try my best to spread the Truth.

"I would not kill myself" - Andrew Tate. Absolutely everyone who knows the Tate brothers knows this to be true.  Once again, they deny him his own rights to a clinical psychologist of his choosing.

@hodgetwins
 other than the 1 in 3000 children who suffer from this gender dysphagia, the remaining "transgenderism" is a sexual perversion ie: drag queens getting off on imagining themselves as sexy women.  Science has spoken 👏

https://youtu.be/L_dIaeNu0JI Turns out 90% of children being told they are  another gender and pushed into mutilation are actually sexually attracted to the same sex, NOT transgender #LGBTQ - how do you reconcile this?

Instead of tracking how “Russia” influenced American attitudes, Hamilton 68 simply collected a handful of mostly real, mostly American accounts, and described their organic conversations as Russian scheming:

The Twitter Files reveal that one of the most common news sources of the Trump era was a scam, making ordinary American political conversations look like Russian spywork

Is anyone at all wondering why they are not sharing this "clinical psychologist's report", why they having been denied virtually all rights, and they themselves appear battered and tortured?  Not even a right to an alternative clinical psychologist? @jordanbpeterson

Please have a look at the pictures shared by 
@TopGirlKeiko
 and determine whether they themselves are being tortured and brainwashed.  The hypocrisy is mind-boggling.

Do you realize the only reason you have a platform (Twitter) is because of Elon Musk?  What other platforms do you guys have?  Figure out where the HQ and servers are for Rumble.  Canada is worse than the Dems here.  Virtually the Entire Globe has no Tech - no Free Speech.

A. B. C. - as easy as 1. 2. 3.

Let me explain.  A attacks and rapes B.  Why does B attack and rape C?

Please stop the Divide and Conquer.  Please stop the cowardice.  Find out who did that to you and take your anger out on them.

Young men, if you don’t know what to do with your life, 

start getting in shape as the first thing in the morning.

Once you’ve got your workout in, 

get your finances up and meet better friends & network.

We seem to not be allowed to say much under the vague protections of "diversity, inclusivity, discrimination".  The Democrats are not only interpreting everything arbitrarily, but slowly replacing every human right there is with limbo.  See JP post on the WHO - post COVID failure
